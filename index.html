    <p>The <font color="#D04FFF"><b>Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)</b></font> is a project to create a large telescope array consisting of a global network of radio telescopes and combining data from several
    very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) stations around the Earth. The aim is to observe the immediate environment of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole <font color="#855E09">Sagittarius A*</font>
    with angular resolution comparable to the black hole's event horizon.</p>
    <p>The EHT is composed of many radio observatories or radio telescope facilities around the world to produce a high-sensitivity, high-angular-resolution telescope. Through the technique
    of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), many independent radio antennae separated by hundreds or thousands of miles can be used in concert to create a "virtual" telescope with
    an effective diameter of the entire planet. The effort includes development and deployment of submillimeter dual polarization receivers, highly stable frequency standards to enable
    very-long-baseline interferometry at 230â€“450 GHz, higher-bandwidth VLBI backends and recorders, as well as commissioning of new submillimeter VLBI sites</p>
    <p>Each year since its first data capture in 2006, the EHT array has moved to add more observatories to its global network of radio telescopes. The first image of the Milky Way's
    supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, could be produced in 2017,[8] and it will also test Einstein's general relativity at the extreme.</p>
    <p>Data collected on hard drives must be transported by jet airliner (a so-called sneakernet) from the various telescopes to the MIT Haystack Observatory in Massachusetts, USA,
    where the data are cross-compared and analyzed on a grid computer made from about 800 CPUs all connected through a 40 Gbit/s network.</p>

    <p>This new 1.3 mm VLBI detection confirms that short-wavelength VLBI of Sgr A* can and will be used to directly probe the event horizon of this black hole candidate: in short, Sgr A* is the right object, VLBI is the right technique, and this decade is the right time.</p>
    <p>Over the next decade, our group proposes to combine existing and planned millimeter/submillimeter facilities into a high-sensitivity, high angular resolution Event Horizon Telescope that will bring us as close to the edge of black hole as we will ever come. This effort will include development and deployment of submillimeter dual-polarization receivers, highly stable frequency standards to enable VLBI at 230-450 GHz, higher-bandwidth VLBI backends and recorders, as well as commissioning of new submillimeter VLBI sites.</p>

    <p>We emphasize that while there is development and procurement involved, the path forward is clear, and recent successful observations have removed much of the risk that would normally be associated with such an ambitious project.</p>
